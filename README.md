# How to use the API:

# 1. Registration:

A user must register with your API in order to use it. This typically involves providing an email address, and a password.

# 2. Authentication:

After registration, the user can log in by sending their credentials to the API's authentication endpoint. The API validates these credentials against the stored user data in your database.

If the credentials are correct, the user is given access to the API.

# 3. API Usage:

The user can now make requests to the API's various endpoints, including those that require authorization. 

The API provides the user with the following functionality:

# Customer:

Allows the creation of a new customer, the editing of a customer, displays the details of a customer and deletes to remove a customer from the database.

# Order:

Allows the creation of a new order, the editing of a order, displays the details of a order and deletes to remove a order from the database.
